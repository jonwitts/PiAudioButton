# PiAudioButton
A simple program that loops an audio track and selects another audio track randomly from a list when a button is pressed.
To install either clone this repo to a Raspberry Pi with wifi setup on it and run setup.sh as root, or run this command:
   curl -L http://bit.ly/PiPyLooper | sudo bash
N.B. It is generally not a good idea to pipe the output of a shortened URL straight into a root shell; but follow the link first and you will see it takes you to the setup.sh file and processes that for you!
